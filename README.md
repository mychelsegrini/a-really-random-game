# Random
 
## Introduction
Random was an individual project made in the Institute of Technology and Leadership (Inteli), São Paulo, Brazil.

The goal of this game is having a "random" but unique story and gameplay. It has three modes: regular, hardcore and impossible.

## Story
Antonio Vivaldi randomly spawns in space, close to the Messier 78 nebula. Frédéric Chopin, who was there before him, tells him that they are in a universe which is trying to restart itself by digging holes in space-time. Chopin, as the first one to spawn there, did not know that he needed to be near the "space-time holes" before they vanish, otherwise he would be in a time loop, arrested in this reality forever. There is a music that starts out of nowhere and the user can only escape this universe when the music is over and he manages to be inside all of the space-time holes in the meantime.
